## Step 1 - Using Codeblocks

Codeblocks are marked using the **back tick (```)**, located on the same key as the tilde, at the head and foot of the code block. Language used can be tagged in line with the header.

``` python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Example usage:
number = 5
result = factorial(number)
print(f"The factorial of {number} is {result}")

```

HTML can be used to:

* Format
* Insert images
