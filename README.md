## Step 1 - Using Codeblocks

Codeblocks are marked using the **back tick (```)** as a header and footer of the code block. Language used can be tagged in line with the head (``` python).

HTML can be used to format documents.

``` python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Example usage:
number = 5
result = factorial(number)
print(f"The factorial of {number} is {result}")

```
